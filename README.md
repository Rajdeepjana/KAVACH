# Kavach Train System

**Arduino-based Indian Railways Train Signaling & Locomotive Simulation**

This project simulates a train signaling system with:
- Trackside signals (Green, Yellow, Red)
- Locomotive dashboard with LCD displaying signal and speed
- Physics engine simulating acceleration/deceleration
- Yellow warning blink and speed limits (Indian freight train realistic)
- Modular phase-wise development (Phase 1 → Phase 5)

## Features
- Real-time train control using Arduino
- Robust serial communication between trackside and locomotive
- Physics-based train motion
- LCD dashboard with override indicators
- Expandable to obstacle detection and emergency braking modules

## Repository Structure
